              Hello I'm Yavuz Dereli and I'm 19 years old, I'm studying at ROC Davinci College (Applicatie & media ontwikkelaar), I was born in the Netherlands, I was raised by my mother
              since I was a little baby. I love going to the gym in my free time and programming with Javascript, C#. I used to play baseball & Squash which were fun to do in my free time.
              I joined a baseball team Portland Poemas where I played for 2 years. My parents divorced when I was 3 months old, I also have 3 sisters they are studying in Turkey and are living
              with my father.

            <h1>Motivation</h1>

            <p>I love to develop myself as a person and the work I'm doing that is why I find it very important to keep going even if its very small progress.
                I always loved to program and learn by myself, but I happened to find a school where they teach us programming. Finally I could go to a school
                where I could enjoy going to, this is one of my few first steps to become a new person. I keep myself motivated by writing random codes even if
                it doesn't do anything than I just adjust them so they actually work, this can sound very boring for a normal person but I really enjoy programming
                and I'm looking forward to learn more new things so I can keep adding them to my projects. Even at home I keep programming to develop myself adding
                keep getting better so it also makes it easier for me at school.

                    I studied since young in the Netherlands I started from elementry school and it took me 6 years.
                    At the end of elementry school You make a exam depending on the result of it you go to a highschool.
                    I ended up getting pretty low score and started with Vmbo basis lwoo at Lmc slinge in Rotterdam.
                    But I proved them wrong by working hard and getting good results which they made me go to Vmbo Kader.
                    After I finished my Highschool I started going to Mbo 4 Specifiek doelgroep begeleider I ended up going to it for a year
                    but It wasn't something I enjoyed going to so I quit after a year. After I quit school I took a year off school, I decided
                    to work on myself I was able to lose a lot of weight and was able to think what I wanted to do in the future. I always
                    had a big love for computers since young and decided I wanted to develop websites, games and applications. Which led me 
                    to sign up for ROC Davinci College Applicatie ontwikkelaar where I can keep programming and learning new things.

                        From time to time I helped at my Uncle's printing company I loved to mess around with photoshop, illustarator.
                        But my real first job started at Kruidvat so I could make some pocket money to get my computer, I was behind the cash register where I was
                        scanning products, taking money, giving money back and stocking shelves. I worked there for around 3 months I wasn't very happy working there because
                        of my colleagues. Currently I'm working at Taco Mundo where I deliver food with a electrik bike since I don't have my drivers liscene yet. Sadly none of 
                        these jobs make me develop as a application developer.
